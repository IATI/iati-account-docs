Registering with IATI
=======================

You can sign up for an IATI Account at [TODO: add link].

After creating your user account, you can add yourself to your organisation. If your organisation is already registered with IATI, simply search for it and select it. 

Registering an organisation for the first time
-----------------------------------------------
If your organisation is not registered yet, you’ll be prompted to enter its details to complete the registration.

New organisations require approval from IATI Support, who will check your unique IATI organisation identifier and ensure that your organisation is not already registered. 

`Contact us <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/get-support/>`_ if you have not heard back within two working days about your organisation's registration.
