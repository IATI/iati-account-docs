To register with IATI, click "Create account" on the `IATI Account homepage <https://dev.account.iatistandard.org/en/>`_.

After signing in to IATI Account for the first time, you will be prompted to complete an onboarding survey. Information collected here will help us signpost you to the most relevant tools and services.

Adding yourself to an organisation
-----------------------------------
If you plan to publish IATI data, you will be prompted to select or add your organisation.

If your organisation is already registered with IATI, simply search for it and select it. 

If your organisation is not registered with IATI yet, create a new organisation to enter information about it.


Organisation approval
-----------------------------
New organisations require approval from IATI Support. We will check your unique IATI organisation identifier and ensure that your organisation is not already registered.

`Contact us <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/get-support/>`_ if you have not received an email within two working days about your organisation's registration.
