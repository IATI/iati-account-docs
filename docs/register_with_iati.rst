Registering with IATI
=======================

.. caution::

   IATI Account is not yet available. It is due to be released during the week 1-5th December 2025. This warning will be removed when the service is live. 

You can sign up for an IATI Account at [link].

After creating your user account, you can add yourself to your organisation. If your organisation is already registered with IATI, simply search for it and select it. 

Creating an organisation
------------------------
If your organisation is not registered with IATI yet, you’ll be prompted to create a new organisation and enter information about it.

New organisations require approval from IATI Support, who will check your unique IATI organisation identifier and ensure that your organisation is not already registered. 

`Contact us <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/get-support/>`_ if you have not heard back within two working days about your organisation's registration.
