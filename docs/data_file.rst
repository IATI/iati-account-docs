Managing your organisation's IATI data files
=============================================

IATI Account is where you manage information about your published IATI data files.

.. attention::

   If you use IATI Publisher, it automatically manages your data file information in IATI Account. You should not edit any file metadata yourself in IATI Account.


Viewing your data files
-------------------------
You can view a list of your IATI data files on your organisation page in IATI Account.


Adding a new data file
-------------------------
To add information about a new IATI data file, click the "Create" button in the "IATI Datasets" section.

You will be prompted to enter the public URL of your dataset and a short name for it.

For more information on IATI data files, see `Creating your own data files <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/publishing-data/how-to-publish-data/creating-files/>`_.


Editing a data file
---------------------
To edit the metadata for one of your files, click on its name in the "IATI Datasets" section of your organisation page.

Click "Edit", change the necessary information, then save.

If you need to make edits to the metadata of a large number of data files, see more information here on `bulk edits to data file metadata <https://docs.account.iatistandard.org/en/latest/bulk_edits/>`_.
