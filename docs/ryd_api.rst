Register Your Data API
=======================

The Register Your Data API allows you to read and update information about your reporting organisation and its IATI data files.

See the `Register Your Data API documentation <https://docs.unified-platform.iatistandard.org/en/latest/register-your-data-api/>`_ for more information.

Developers can enable users that have an IATI account to log into their application via IATI single sign on. This allows use of IATI APIs such as Register My Data. See our `Developer Guide <https://docs.unified-platform.iatistandard.org/en/latest/developer-guide-registry-replacement/>`_ for more information.
