Register Your Data API
=======================

The Register Your Data API allows you to read and update information about your reporting organisation and its IATI data files.

See the `Register Your Data API documentation <https://docs.unified-platform.iatistandard.org/en/latest/register-your-data-api/>`_ for more information.

Developers can enable users, with an IATI account, to log into their application via OIDC. This allows use of IATI APIs including Register My Data. See [Developer Guide] for more information.
