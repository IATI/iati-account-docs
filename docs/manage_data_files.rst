Managing your organisation's IATI data files
=============================================

`IATI Account <https://account.iatistandard.org/en/>`_ is where you manage information about your published IATI data files.

.. attention::

   If you use IATI Publisher, it automatically manages your data file information in IATI Account. You should not edit any file metadata yourself in IATI Account.

.. attention::

   IATI Account does not offer a CSV import option for uploading information on multiple data files at once, unlike the IATI Registry. If you need to add or edit a large number of files, please `contact us for advice <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/get-support/>`_.
