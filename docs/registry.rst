IATI Registry Migration
=======================

The `IATI Registry <https://iatiregistry.org/>`_ was permanently replaced by a new site, `IATI Account <https://account.iatistandard.org/en/>`_, in December 2025. Some read-only functionality from the IATI Registry is now available on the `IATI Dashboard <https://dashboard.iatistandard.org/>`_. 

You can find more details about this work on IATI Connect: `IATI Registry Relaunch (Dec 2025) <https://www.iaticonnect.org/technical-cop/stream/topic/iati-registry-relaunch-scheduled-dec-2025>`_.

What you need to know
----------------------

* All existing IATI user accounts, organisations, and dataset information were automatically migrated to the new service.

* You will receive an email with instructions on how to reset your password and sign in to IATI Account for the first time. You will need to do this before you can use IATI Publisher.
