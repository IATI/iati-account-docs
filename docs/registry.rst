IATI Registry Migration
=======================

We will be replacing the `IATI Registry <https://iatiregistry.org/>`_ during the week 1-5th December. During this time, you won’t be able to log in or make any changes to your organisation information or IATI data file metadata.

The current IATI Registry will be permanently replaced by a new tool, IATI Account, along with enhanced functionality on the `IATI Dashboard <https://dashboard.iatistandard.org/>`_. 

You can find more details about this work here on IATI Connect: `IATI Registry Relaunch (Dec 2025) <https://www.iaticonnect.org/technical-cop/stream/topic/iati-registry-relaunch-scheduled-dec-2025>`_.

What you need to know
----------------------

* If you need to make changes to your file metadata on the IATI Registry, please do so by Friday 28th November (midnight, UTC). Changes won’t be possible after that until migration is complete on 5th December.

* No action is needed during the week of migration. All existing user accounts, organisations, and dataset information will be automatically migrated to the new service.

* After the migration, you will receive an email with instructions on how to reset your password and log in to IATI Account for the first time.

* Guidance will be available on this IATI Account docs site to guide you through using the new tool.
