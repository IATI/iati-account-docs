.. attention::

   This documentation is written as if the new identity service was live so that all we need to do in order to launch is to remove this warning. The service is not yet live.


You can sign up for an IATI Account at TODO: add link. 

An IATI Account lets you manage the information that IATI holds about you and your organisation. If your organisation reports using IATI, you can manage the location of the data via your account as well. 

An IATI Account lets you log in to IATI Publisher.
