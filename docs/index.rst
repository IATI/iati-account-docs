IATI Account Documentation
**************************


.. attention::

   This documentation supports the new IATI Account service, which is not yet live. This warning will be removed when the service is live. 

An IATI Account lets you manage the information that IATI holds about you and your organisation. If your organisation reports IATI data, you can manage the location of the data via your account as well. 

An IATI Account lets you log in to IATI Publisher. No other IATI services support IATI Account. 

.. attention::

   The IATI Secretariat is working to integrate all IATI services with IATI Account. While this work continues, existing login methods will continue to work.
