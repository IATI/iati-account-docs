===================================
Adding yourself to an organisation
===================================

If you plan to publish IATI data, you will be prompted to select or add your organisation in IATI Account after completing the user onboarding survey.

If your organisation is already registered with IATI, simply search for it and select it.

If your organisation is not registered with IATI yet, there is the option to "create an organisation".

.. note::

   You can link your IATI Account to more than one organisation. However, some IATI tools — such as IATI Publisher — only allow each user to work with a single organisation.


Organisation approval
-----------------------------
New organisations require approval from IATI Support. We will check your unique IATI organisation identifier and ensure that your organisation is not already registered.

`Contact us <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/get-support/>`_ if you have not received an email within two working days about your organisation's registration.
